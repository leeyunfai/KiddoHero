# KiddoHero
Click to play: https://faiprod.itch.io/kiddo-hero

A simple game where a kiddo tries his very best to avoid the very things which he fears in his life. i.e. Anger, Vegetable, Failure & Insects.

Left/Right arrow keys to control the player movement. Spacebar to dash.

**Summary:**
- I designed the avatar, enemy sprites and background using Gimp.
- Self sourced copyright-free music and integrated it into the game.
- Coded using C# and Unity 2D Game Engine to produce a working PC-compatible 2D Game.
